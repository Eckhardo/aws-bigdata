Create a Kinesis Stream with 1 Shard called RuskenOrders
#################

1.log in EC2 with PUTTY:
2. cd /etc/aws-kinesis
3. sudo nano agent.json
4a. SET "kinesis.endpoint": "kinesis.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com"
4. add to flow array:
  {
      "filePattern": "/var/log/cadabra/*.log",
      "kinesisStream": "RuskenOrders",
      "partitionKeyOption": "RANDOM",
      "dataProcessingOptions": [
         {
            "optionName": "CSVTOJSON",
            "customFieldNames": ["InvoiceNo", "StockCode", "Description", "Quantity", "InvoiceDate", "UnitPrice", "Customer", "Country"]
         }
      ]
    }
5.   sudo service aws-kinesis-agent restart  
6. Go back to home directory : cd ~
7. Start the Python Script: sudo ./LogGenerator.py 50000 (Generate 50000 log entries)
8. Check that the log entries have been written to the cadabra folder into file *log:
    - cd /var/log/cadabra/  -> ls : see the log data have been written by the script
9. Now check what the Agent has already sent to firehose: cd ~ ->   tail -f /var/log/aws-kinesis-agent/aws-kinesis-agent.log 
10: Check Kinesis Streams Cloud Watch Metrics (PutRecords) to verify the success.

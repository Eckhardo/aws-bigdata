Setup an Delivery Stream with Firehose with Kinesis Agent as Source and S3 as Destination
#####################
1. Log into AWS Console, go to Kinesis
2. Create Delivery Stream named "PurchaseLogs"
3. Use Kinesis Agent as  a "Direct Put Source" (alternatively choose Kinesis SDK (PutRecord or PuRecordBatch), IoT, Cloud Watch Logs or Cloud Watch Events)
4. Ditch the option to either Process the Data by Lambda or Convert the Data by AWS Glue, since the source is already structured csv files.
5. Define the Destination: S3 bucket "my-rusken-orderlogs
6. Define Buffer size with 5 MB and Buffer Interval to 60 seconds (minimum value)
7. Ditch S3 Compression and S3 Encryption
8. Define an IAM Role for Firehose to access the S3 bucket (also includes policies for Lambda, Glue and Kinesis)
9. Finally create the Delivery Stream
